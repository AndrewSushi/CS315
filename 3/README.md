## 1 - Minimum Psanning Tree
![MST](imgs/mst.png)
Consider the graph above. You will be building a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for this
graph in two ways. When there is a tie on the edge weights, consider the edges or nodes
in alphabetical order. For example, for an edge, this means (A,F) before (B,C), and (C,D)
before (C,G). Show all intermediate steps, and the set of edges contained in the MST.
(a) Prim’s method.
(b) Kruskal’s method
